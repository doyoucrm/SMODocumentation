## Introduction to Customer Insights - Journeys Forms

In Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys, marketing forms are inbound communication channels allowing customers to engage with your organization. These forms, now termed as 'Marketing Forms', are crucial for tasks such as newsletter registrations, quote requests, etc. They consist of various fields and graphical elements, and can be easily created and customized using a form editor. Notably, these forms are limited to updating a single entity, like a Lead or Contact, simplifying their configuration and maintenance.

**Key Updates:**

- Forms can be quickly published and are hosted on Content Delivery Network (CDN) for faster load times.
- Journey orchestration is more targeted, with specific triggers for Customer Insights - Journeys forms.
- Direct embedding of forms into web pages is now possible without needing a separate form page.

## Use Marketing Form Insights

Marketing Form Insights offer valuable data on how your contacts interact with your marketing forms. This data is combined across all instances where your form is used, but can be filtered by date range. By examining the insights, you can determine the total number of form submissions, new contacts created, and leads generated, among other key performance indicators (KPIs). This information can help you identify trends and make data-driven decisions to optimize your marketing efforts.

Follow these step-by-step instructions to access and use Marketing Form Insights for your John Deere dealership marketing forms:

2. Choose the marketing form you want to analyze by clicking on its name.
3. Once the form is open, click on the "Insights" tab.

Here, you'll find the following categories of insights:

* Overview: Displays KPIs such as total form submissions, contacts created or updated, and leads created or updated by the form.
* Submissions: Shows a table with the full content of each submission made through the form, including metadata and important field values.

To better understand the insights and KPIs provided:

2. An info icon will appear; hover your mouse pointer over this icon to view a tooltip with a description of that value.
