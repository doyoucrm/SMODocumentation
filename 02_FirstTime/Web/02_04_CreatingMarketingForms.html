<p>In Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys, marketing forms are inbound communication channels allowing customers to engage with your organization. These forms, now termed as 'Marketing Forms', are crucial for tasks such as newsletter registrations, quote requests, etc. They consist of various fields and graphical elements, and can be easily created and customized using a form editor. Notably, these forms are limited to updating a single entity, like a Lead or Contact, simplifying their configuration and maintenance.</p>

	<li><strong>Key Updates:</strong></li>
    <li>Forms can be quickly published and are hosted on Content Delivery Network (CDN) for faster load times.</li>
    <li>Journey orchestration is more targeted, with specific triggers for Customer Insights - Journeys forms.</li>
    <li>Direct embedding of forms into web pages is now possible without needing a separate form page.</li>
</ul>

<p>Marketing Form Insights offer valuable data on how your contacts interact with your marketing forms. This data is combined across all instances where your form is used, but can be filtered by date range. By examining the insights, you can determine the total number of form submissions, new contacts created, and leads generated, among other key performance indicators (KPIs). This information can help you identify trends and make data-driven decisions to optimize your marketing efforts.</p>
